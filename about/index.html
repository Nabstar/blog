    <p>
        An embedded freak, wonderer, internet nomad that's passionate about <br>
        electronics and software that powers them. Loves tinkering with them <br>
        as well :-)
    </p>

    <p>
        To be honest, I derive pleasure and joy breaking apart electronics to <br>
        examine and study them and hopefully demystify them for fun :-))
    </p>

    <p>
        I often branch out to writing code as a seasoned software developer <br>
        when not tinkering with them electronics.

    <p>
        I have found these programming languages to be fascinating and worth <br>
        spending time on. 

        <div class="languages">
            <ul>
                <li>Fourth</li>
                <li>web assembly</li>
                <li>Rust</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </p>

    <p>Happy tinkering yeyyh!!!</p>
